Caption: Imagine if beauty came with a luxurious product that combines flawless coverage with a lightweight feelâ€”all for an affordable price. 

Would people want more Lakme products? The answer, it seems, is yes.

These are among the qualitiesâ€”along with diverse shade options, easy application, and a long-lasting finishâ€”that have made the Lakme Foundation a staple for customers across India and beyond. The beauty industry saw a massive shift towards inclusive makeup shades in recent years, and Lakme is on track to release even more shades by 2025, catering to all skin tones.

The demand for high-quality, affordable beauty products has been rising globally since the 2000s. But this need has hit South Asia harder and faster than manufacturers anticipatedâ€”a trend also being observed in Western markets where consumers are seeking quality at a lower price point.

Meeting this demand has become a top priority among beauty brands worldwide. Lakme and other industry leaders like L'OrÃ©al and Maybelline have been innovating with premium ingredients and advanced formulations to satisfy a wide range of consumers. Yet, consumer preference for high-quality makeup persists across all demographics, ages, and income levels. Those who buy high-end makeup say they do so for the experience and product quality. Those who donâ€™t often cite budget or lack of shade availability as reasons for opting out.

Market analysts suggest the increasing demand for affordable, inclusive beauty products reflects a deeper cultural shift towards accessible luxury rather than merely a price-driven choice.
