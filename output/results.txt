Caption: Imagine if having children came with more than $150,000 in cheap loans, a subsidized minivan and a lifetime exemption from income taxes.⁠
⁠
Would people have more kids? The answer, it seems, is no.⁠
⁠
These are among the benefits—along with cheap child care, extra vacation and free fertility treatments—that have been doled out to parents in different parts of Europe, a region at the forefront of the worldwide baby shortage. Europe’s overall population shrank during the pandemic and is on track to contract by about 40 million by 2050, according to United Nations statistics.⁠
⁠
Birthrates have been falling across the developed world since the 1960s. But the decline hit Europe harder and faster than demographers expected—a foreshadowing of the sudden drop in the U.S. fertility rate in recent years.⁠
⁠
Reversing the decline in birthrates has become a national priority among governments worldwide. Europe and other demographically challenged economies in Asia such as South Korea and Singapore have been pushing back against the demographic tide with lavish parental benefits for a generation. Yet falling fertility has persisted among nearly all age groups, incomes and education levels. Those who have many children often say they would have them even without the benefits. Those who don’t say the benefits don’t make enough of a difference.⁠
⁠
Demographers suggest the reluctance to have kids is a fundamental cultural shift rather than a purely financial one.⁠

First Comment: We need to talk about infertility as well, I think there are multiple factors impacting the birth rate

co.kerouac: Oh shut up... We have more than enough people to slow down for a little while.. the idea that we have to be in a constant state of growth or everything is going to collapse is just dumb.  How about we figure out a more sustainable way that doesn't require a neverending supply of worker bees destroying the planet in order for us to make our system work ...
helenadze: Hungary is in Europe and Europe is not a country you dumbs.
asseituna: birth rates indicate a measurement of human units within a nation that functions on them. a couple having many kids does not align with our ancestral evolution. our species isn’t designed for it and our bodies and minds are averse to it when you remove the religious family narrative that outlines our modern society. but it’s a silly outline that is being erased by critical thinking and inward reflection. it’s awesome
moshxaf: I just think we’re gonna realizing how fucking shitty men are if they’re gonna be promiscuous ADHD polyamorous over here f*** everything
